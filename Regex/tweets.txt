Q1. Hey, y'all. My novel SLAY is about a black teen developer who creates a Wakanda-inspired VR video game, and battles a real-life racist troll intent on destroying it. It'll be out in Fall '19 from Simon Pulse! #novel19s

The world is pretty terrible right now, but a friend is undergoing major surgery to give my wife a life-changing kidney transplant. That's amazing.
Soooo I'm actually seeing people on the left say that the Cherokee Nation is wrong for their statement and I'm about done with all y'all today.
@AngryBlackLady Sounds about white.
On the cover of Captain America's 1st issue, he punched Adolf Hitler in the face. Enraged, American Nazis called Marvel with threats &amp; loitered in the streets outside. So creator Jack Kirby rolled up his sleeves &amp; went outside to punch them too.   Today's Marvel? Not so much.
Dad: *pauses tv* Rose, tell me about today Rose: it was good. S. cried a lot D: oh no, do you know why? R: Maybe he wanted to watch TV but they wouldn't let him. R: *mic drop* *Dad and mom laugh* R: Or maybe they made him go to school when he didn't want to. R: *Stares at Dad*

@LauraLoomer It's not a war on men..... it's a war on sexism and sexual assault... pls get it together and do some research. Feminism is not about hating men &amp; those that do hate aren't real feminists

Happy #IndigenousPeopleDay !
@NYDailyNews My PTSD was fairly well controlled until Dr. Ford came forward. Then seeing Kavanaugh in the hearings, I started having flashbacks because his anger and hatred reminded me SO MUCH of my abusive ex. Yes, some of us do see SO's in him, if we have/had toxic men in our lives. Not all
@NYDailyNews Why don't they see their daughter, sister, wife in Christine Blasey-Ford and Deborah Ramirez?  Is Conway saying only men's lives and feelings really matter in tRump's America. @KellyannePolls
Do you ever think about how Silicon Valley figured out how to fit more servers in by stacking them on top of each other but they haven't figured out you can do that with homes.
I don't want to hear your moralizing. You moralized while I fought Nazis. And now I've helped take down multiple Nazi groups and changed military policy and I didn't do it through moralizing.  You want your rights?  Roll up your sleeves and start getting ready for a dirty fight.
Maybe focus first on keeping your son from assaulting women? https://t.co/btIsiMdmwA
We're cancelling a planned six-figure digital video ad expenditure for Phil Bredesen in Tennessee due to his Kavanaugh position. And similarly will be pulling all planned campaigning on behalf of Joe Manchin in West Virginia if he votes yes. Kavanaugh is unfit for the Court.
If he doesn't get confirmed then all of Brett's screaming and crying will have been for Kavanaught.
Today, @lisamurkowski came through. Thank you.
Proud of you, @lisamurkowski. Thank you for putting our democracy first. #StopKanavaugh
You're one of my senators so how about telling your constituents in as much detail as possible what the report said @SenGillibrand? https://t.co/SPZqsf2j9I
@sam2lucky13 @SenWhitehouse @ScottHech What BS. Where there's so much smoke, there's fire. There was no smoke around Gorsuch, even though his seat was stolen from America Garland.
Thank you @SenatorHeitkamp for believing women and seeing how Kavanaugh   has disqualified himself with his temperament and his lies. https://t.co/U8eYfvopQN
The reason sex with a vampire doesn't usually result in pregnancy isn't because their sperm is dead, it's because the vampire can't come inside without an invitation.  Thank you for coming to my HaunTED Talk.

Ching Shih was a prostitute born in 1775 who became the most feared pirate queen in all of China - launching the infamous Red Flag Fleet.

@benramosss @orangerie___ They didn't know the guys, they could barely walk.. they could barely stand.. I'm happy I took them home. Because I know what was about to go down, and not on my watch
i was just in a convenience store and saw a woman in her 60s lean over to read a newspaper headline about the #KavanaughVote and she said 
No one was on trial yesterday but it feels like all survivors were sentenced to life in prison.
great day for unfollowing straight white dudes who talk about a self-propagating hegemony of unrepentant rapists like a fun interesting thought experiment and not a reason to burn mansions by the acre and erect a scaffold for this neat guillotine i just built
Every single man who is angrily defending Kavanaugh should be immediately investigated for sexual assault.  #BelieveChristine

Imagine being so brave that you come forward with testimony that will likely ruin your own life just to protect the lives of strangers.  Thank you, Dr. Blasey Ford. Thank you, Deborah Ramirez. Thank you, Julie Swetnick. https://t.co/7SaE3hYpiU

Thought for the day, from a FB friend: I wish I could get through a day without having to hear about another Republican penis.
@WayneFreedman @WildRootsStudio Having been the victim of an otherwise wonderful  man who had abhorrent behavior when drunk, I almost feel sorry for Kavanaugh, BUT the wonderful man I knew felt horrible about his behavior, apologized, backed that up by getting sober. He faced his demons squarely in the face.
No one who enjoyed high school should be hired for anything

I was manipulated and sexually abused and am in the process of claiming my power back ..and when I'm ready to talk publicly about it I will be heard and not hated but forgiveness and understanding which is the hardest hurdle to overcome everyone who wounds is wounded themselves

@VancityReynolds Can we have @AnnaKendrick47 as Lady Deadpool?
Never is it more evident that sexual preference isn't a choice than in the fact that every woman over 35, no matter where she started, isn't now a lesbian.
@jemelehill You understood that the men and women who play sports are complex, interesting and not just there to be used as entertainers.  Keep speaking my sister and bless all your future endeavors.
I hope they cast a black Superman. It would nice for a brotha to finally be faster than a speeding bullet.
Having marijuana in your house is a perfectly rational response to a world where the police can break into and kill you because they feel like it.
@auchamps4life @4kris2say @surge214_sergio @NYDailyNews @lkjtexas Background checks aren't as detailed depending on your clearance. Usually, they just look to see if you lied about your criminal record. A Supreme Court nomination is going to warrant deeper scrutiny. But hey, he should be happy, at least he got his hearing. Garland didn't
@THR Straight guys having group fun is Literally Happening EVERY DAY, in EVERY TOWN &amp; in every HS &amp; College. This the the Most COMMON thing. I'm amazed it takes a Legend like Paul McCartney to publicly announce what Everybody has been doing for ever. I'm more amazed anyone is unaware
